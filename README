This is my telegram bot!

The bot receives a location from the user (any telegram location),
and replies what the user should wear based on their location.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
        - telegram and weathermap tokens used in this project are hidden on the bot.py file that on git
        - there are two more files for this project that aren't in this repo,
          but necessary for the bot to operate on heroku's servers
